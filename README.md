# Intelligent Systems

Code produced in the context of the course "Intelligent Systems" given at the [UNIVERSIDAD POLITÃ‰CNICA DE MADRID](https://www.upm.es/) during year 2021-2022. 

## Natural language processing

This small R script contains the code that was used to produce the plots and results presented in the report.pdf file. To run the code, you should install the required R packages (quanteda, spacyR and utf8). If you don't have it already you may need to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows). Afterwards, running the following commands creates the necessary spacy environment : 

```R
library(spacyr)
spacy_install(prompt=FALSE)
spacy_download_langmodel('es')
```

Please note that the same code was used to process the two datasets used, so in order to reproduce all results, you should first execute the code, then change line 5 to :
```R
lines <- readLines("spa_news_2021_10K-sentences.txt",encoding = "UTF-8")
```
Then execute the script again to see the plots for year 2021.
